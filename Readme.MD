# API Challenge number 2 for WD85

Construcing a page using the Coinlayer API to display current costs of various assets.

I deployed this code to Firebase and found I needed to use https which is fine. Unfortunately, it seems that coinlayer's api restricts https access on a free account.

The code does work locally though.
