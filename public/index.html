          coinlayer API

        <p>
          What I thought would be a very simple "select from JavaScript populated dropdown to return asset price" turned into quite the ordeal.

        <p>
          I deployed this code to Firebase and found I needed to use https which is fine. Unfortunately, it seems that coinlayer's
          API restricts https access on a free account. I was unaware of this until 9 PM last night as all my calls prior were using http. I tried to allow insecure content to be loaded through the &lt;meta&gt; tags but that isn't allowed with their API either. The code does run locally. Sorry for the inconvenience. I never thought to try https before deployment.
